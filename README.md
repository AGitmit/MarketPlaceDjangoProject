# MarketPlaceDjangoProject
This is just a random Django project for practice.... I've built a marketplace with a bunch of features.
For this project I have used:
  * HTML
  * CSS (Tailwind)
  * Python
  * Django -
    * User authentication
    * User sessions
    * DB models design and management
    * CRUD operations
    * Dynamic URL's
    * DB migrations.
    * etc.
